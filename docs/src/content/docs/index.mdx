<Fragment set:html={LOGCHEF} />

Logchef is a dedicated log query and visualization interface built specifically for ClickHouse. It fills a critical gap in the ClickHouse ecosystem, providing a powerful log explorer without reinventing log collection or storage.

**Focus on querying, not ingestion:** Logchef intentionally doesn't handle log collection, relying instead on established tools like Vector, Filebeat, Promtail, or Logstash that already do this job reliably.

## Why ClickHouse for Logs?

ClickHouse's columnar architecture makes it ideal for log analytics:

- **Blazing-fast aggregations** over billions of log entries
- **Efficient compression** dramatically reduces storage costs
- **Powerful SQL** with analytical extensions for complex log queries
- **Column-oriented design** optimized for searching specific fields in large datasets

Logchef provides the missing piece: a specialized, user-friendly interface to unlock this potential.

## Key Features

### Query Your Way

- **Simple Search Syntax**: `status=200`, `level="error" AND service="payment-api"`
